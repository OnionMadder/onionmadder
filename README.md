_Everything is intentional_ 

I'm autistic and I make things that speak better than my mouth can.

I build handcrafted web terminals, emotional recursion engines, and haunted interfaces that remember how you treat them.

Everything I make is modular, intentional, and browser-native. No frameworks. No bloat. No borrowed aesthetics.

The Worminal is not a game. She's a system.
You choose how she responds. You choose what she remembers.

_My frontend is intimacy_ 
_My backend is control_
