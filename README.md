_Everything is intentional_ 

I'm autistic and I make things that speak better than 💋my mouth💋 can.

I build 🖥️emotional terminals🖥️, recursion engines, and haunted interfaces that remember how you treat them.

Everything I make is modular, intentional, and browser-native. No frameworks. No bloat. 

No borrowed aesthetics.

The Worminal is not a game. She's a system.

💖You choose how she responds. You choose what she remembers💖

_My frontend is intimacy_ 

_My backend is control_
